## Exercise 2: Simple Sums - 15 Marks
#In this exercise, you will create and work with integer variables, perform arithmetic operations, and print the result to the console.
### Steps:
#1. Declare a variable and initialize it with the integer value `8`.
#2. Declare a second variable and initialize it with the integer value `10`.
#3. Declare a third variable that stores the sum of first two numbers.
#4. Print the value of the sum to the console.
#Answer:
# Exercise - Simple Addition
# This program stores two numbers in variables, adds them together,
# and prints the result. This shows how Python can perform basic
# arithmetic using variables.

# Store the numbers in variables
a = 8
b = 10

# Add the numbers and store the result in a new variable

c = a + b  # 'c' now holds the sum of a and b

# Output the result
print(c)
